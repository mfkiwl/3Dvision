3Dvision

[3D computer vision code repository]

In this repository, you will find various MATLAB, C/C++ open-source code that is closely related with 3D computer vision,
ranging from feature tracking, segmentation, object recognition, and of course 3D reconstruction.
My source code is mainly based on some well-known computer vision books:

1. An Invitation to 3-D Vision (Yi Ma, Stefano Soatto, Jana Kosecka, S. Shankar Sastry), Springer, 2004
2. Introductory Techniques for 3D computer vision (Emanuele Trucco, Alessandro Verri), Prentice Hall, 1998
3. Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision (Richard Hartley, Andrew Zisserman), Cambridge, 2004
